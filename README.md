# About the game
Elemental Basket is a fast-paced 2D arcade game that focuses on reflex. 
The main idea is that the player is a magical basket that switches colors in order to catch the right falling element (Earth, Air, Fire, Water). 
The more you catch, the more you gain but miss some and its game over.
The game emphasizes speed, precision, and timing in a simple art style, just like the small games from our childhood.


# Gameplay
The game starts automatically after running the code. 
Colored orbs with animated particles specific for each element begin to fall from the top of the screen randomly. 
In that moment the player (the basket) must use the keys A (to move left) and D (to move right) and the mouse scroll wheel (up and down) to switch the basket’s current color (in our case, specific element).
If you catch the matching orb, you score, if you miss or mismatch, you lose. 
Catch as many points as possible or die trying. 
And if you happen to die, you can simply press ‘R’ to restart.
   
# How to win
For each caught orb that matches the basket, the player gains 5 points, whereas for each missed or mismatched orb, the player loses two points. 
The players win when the score is bigger than 100 and lose when it is under -5; the more they catch, the more they can miss after before losing and having to restart.

# Looks
The game is simple, fun, quite childish but clean with vibrant 2D visuals.
Each element has its defining colour to distinguish and assign. Fire is red, Water is blue, Earth is
brown and Air is grey. 
Every orb has their particle.
The background is blue, like a clear blue sky, just perfect for a game.
